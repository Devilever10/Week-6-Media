    <p>Much of what occurs in Manila, the major capital of the Philippines happens in the open. Children play basketball, there are old men sleeping on the sidewalk, prostitutes buy street food from stalls, you hear fireworks that are actually gunshots.</p>

    <p> This film seeks to depict a nuanced and accurate depiction of both the dirtyness and beauty that exits within this setting. To shine a light on humanity, both good and bad.

        <h3>List of Scenes</h3>
        <ol>
          Scene-1 [EDSA (Epifano De Los Santos Avenue)] Traffic Jam on EDSA during rain, children playing outside and the camera switches between the interior of the Jeepney as well as the outside environment, a young man inside of the Jeepney observes people on
          their phones and the driver’s visual discontent at being stuck in a jam during rush hour. He hears a thumping sound coming from outside. As he stares out into the gridlocked highway, he sees a Bungisngis (Cyclops) leading a herd of Carabao,
          the man notices that it is the giant that is causing the traffic jam, his herd seems to be preventing the cars from moving forward. The Bungisngis is monstrous but laughing, and has a charismatic weight about him (likened after Ferdinand Marcos
          and Joseph Estrada). He carries his carabao and leads them through the traffic. The Camera Pans up to the rainset view of cars stuck under the rain as the title Kalye appears.

        <ol> Scene-3 [Tondo] An old man sleeps by the corner of a shanty town in the Tondo District, surrounding him are areas filled with trash and makeshift houses. A sudden rustling from the ground awakens him as he looks at a mound of dirt being created
          around the trash. From the dirt emerges an old wizened hobgoblin (Duwende) who starts sniffing the air for food. The old man looks at the hobgoblin knowingly and takes out a rice cake (bibingka) wrapped in a banana leaf. The old goblin stares
          at the food longingly, and the old man breaks the bibingka in half and shares it with the creature. They both share a meal together, and after they finish eating the Duwende raises his staff and a shelter is formed around the man and goblin.
          They thank each other for the kindness and the Duwende disappears into the ground. The sun sets on the on the old man in his house. </ol> <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/kY6htA/SS2359764.jpg" alt="SS2359764" width="400px">

        <ol> Scene-5 [Intramuros] Within Intramuros in the early hours of the morning, (The Walled City) several young men play Streetball in the Anda Street Graffiti Wall. Surrounding them are street art murals around them on all sides. As they play the game
          two Horsetaurs (Tikbalang) approach the teams and join in the game with one Tikbalang playing for each team. Each of the Tikbalang are at least twice the height of the young men, they run like wild stallions with a certain kind of majesty. As
          they control the ball, it seems as they are making the men to play better. The match is intense as both teams score two points each. The Tie-breaker is broken when a young man manages to shoot a slam dunk getting past one of the Tikabalang.

        <ol> Scene-6 [Pasig River] As the night turns to daybreak the moon is full on the sky above the Pasig River that joins Laguna to Manila Bay. Two fishermen are out, casting lines into the river, hoping to catch some tilapia. The river is polluted with
          trash and waste dumped by several industrial companies that line the banks of the river. There’s a certain stillness between the two fishermen as they wait patiently on the silent river. Suddenly one of the men’s lines gets a sudden pull, the
          boat shakes as his line bends into the murky waters. He pulls back trying to hold onto the pole, but the force is too strong. The other fisherman comes behind him and tries to help him pull the fish out. And suddenly a Giant Sea Serpent (Bakunawa)
          emerges from the water flying straight up from the river high into the sky. The Bakunawa flies through the clouds and eats the moon with its maw, than descends back into the water. The boat is rocked by the waves of the beast. The sun arises
          as the serpent descends back into the water. </ol> <img src="https://preview.ibb.co/e4cDYA/2737720303-687210f318-o.jpg" alt="Pasig" width="400px">
